## CORRUPTION AND INFAMY

Heretic characters begin with 0 Corruption and replace their Fate stat
with an Infamy stat. A Heretic's Corruption of 0 is the same as a
loyalist character's Corruption of 10. If an Imperial character gains 10
Corruption, the player and GM may wish to convert that character to a
Heretic character by resetting to 0 Corruption and gaining an Infamy
track (this will reset to the default Fate point value, regardless of
how upgraded it was before: The Emperor's Light no longer blesses them).

Instead of just the usual +3 to rolls or +2 to Defense that Fate points
grant, Infamy points grant differing bonuses depending on your
Corruption level as follows:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Corruption Level                  | Infamous Bonus                    |
+===================================+===================================+
| 0-2                               | -   Add +3 to a Dice Pool for one |
|                                   |     roll                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Add +2 to Defense for one     |
|                                   |     turn                          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 3-6                               | -   Heal 1d5 Wounds               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Re-roll a test once           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Add one success to an already |
|                                   |     successful test               |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 7-10                              | -   Heal 1d10 Wounds              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Gain 10 initiative for one    |
|                                   |     turn                          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

In addition, the character's alignment will give a Bonus and a Drawback
to Infamy use (Unaligned characters gain neither):

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Chaos God               Infamy Bonus            Infamy Drawback
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  Nurgle                  When rolling to heal    May not spend Infamy to

                          automatically heal the  
                          highest possible number 

  Khorne                  May spend an Infamy     When rolling to heal
                          point to automatically  wounds using Infamy,

                          with one success        to a minimum of 1
